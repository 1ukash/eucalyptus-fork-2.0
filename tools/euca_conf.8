.TH euca_conf 8 "August 2, 2009" "euca_conf"

.SH NAME
euca_conf \- configuration tool for Eucalyptus

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B euca_conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes the
.B euca_conf
command which is used to configure Eucalyptus. There are few component to
a Eucalyptus installation: the cloud controller (CLC), walrus, one or more
cluster controller (CC), one storage controller (SC) per CC and node
controller (NC).

CLC is the endpoint for the client tool, and contains the administrative
UI (reachable at https://localhost:8443 on the CLC machine).

walrus is the S3 compatible storage for Eucalyptus.

CC controls a number of NCs, provisions the network for VMs.

SC gives EBS functionality to a cluster.

NC interact with the local hypervisor to start/stop/control instances.


.SH OPTIONS

.BI --help
.RS
display some help
.RE

.BI --enable\ {walrus|sc|cloud}
.RS
Service to enable at the next start time. Needs to be run on the machine
which has the service to start.
.RE

.BI --disable\ {walrus|sc|cloud}
.RS
Disable services, preventing them to be started.
.RE

.BI --register-cluster\ <name>\ <hostname>
.RS
Register a CC with the CLC. To allow provisioning of instances, at least
one CC is needed on a running Eucalyptus installation.
This command needs to be ran on the CLC machine, and the
CC machine (possibly the same machine) needs to be reachable. The keys
needs to be transferred from the CLC to the CC machine to enable
secure operation, and ssh is used, so this command may ask for a password.

The user need to choose a name per CC.
.RE

.BI --deregister-cluster\ <name>\ <hostname>
.RS
Deregister a CC.
.RE

.BI --register-sc\ <CC>\ <hostname>
.RS
Register a SC with the CLC. The SC is needed to provide EBS support to a
cluster logically resides with the CC.
This command needs to be ran on the CLC machine, and the
SC machine (possibly the same machine) needs to be reachable. The keys
needs to be transferred from the CLC to the SC machine to enable
secure operation, and ssh is used, so this command may ask for a password.

There has to be a CC already registered, since the SC works in conjunction
with a CC.
.RE

.BI --deregister-sc\ <hostname>
.RS
Deregister a running SC. You will need to register another SC to
have EBS functionality for a named cluster.

.B WARNING:
running this command will invalidate volumes and snapshots which this SC
is responsible for.
.RE

.BI --register-walrus\ <hostname>
.RS
Register a walrus with the CLC. A walrus is needed for a running Eucalyptus
installation. This command needs to be ran on the CLC machine, and the
walrus machine (possibly the same machine) needs to be reachable. The keys
needs to be transferred from the CLC to the walrus machine to enable
secure operation, and ssh is used, so this command may ask for a password.
.RE

.BI --deregister-walrus\ <hostname>
.RS
Deregister a running walrus. You will need to register another walrus to
have a functional Eucalyptus installation.

.B WARNING:
running this command will invalidate the uploaded and running images,
kernels and ramdisk! So you (and all the users) will have to upload new
images.
.RE

.BI --register-nodes\ host\ [host ...]
.RS
Register NCs with a CC. NC and CC should be on the same network. This
command needs to be run the CC which will controll the NCs. The keys
needs to be transferred from the CC to the NC for enable secure operation,
and ssh is used, so this command may ask for a password.
.RE

.BI --deregister-nodes\ host\ [host ...]
.RS
Intruct the CC to ignore specified NCs.
.RE

.BI --list-walruses
.RS
List registered walruses. The command needs to be run on the CLC.
.RE

.BI --list-scs
.RS
List registered storage controllers. The command needs to be run on the CLC.
.RE
.
.BI --list-clusters
.RS
List registered cluster controllers. The command needs to be run on the CLC.
.RE
.
.BI --instances\ <path>
.RS
The NC needs disk space to keep a copy of the running instances. Some
copies are cached for faster startup time. This instruct the NC to user
.I path
as the local cache.
.I path
better be an empty directory, since the NC needs to initialized it every
time.
.RE

.BI --version
.RS
Print the version of Eucalyptus.
.RE

.BI --setup
.RS
This command needs to run as root, before the first-time startup or
Eucalyptus. Eucalyptus runs as an unprivileged user (EUCA_USER in config)
but to interact with hypervisor and disk image, it will need to escalate
privilege. To do so we use a command (euca_rootwrap) and this command set
it up properly.
.RE

.BI --check\ {nc|cc|cloud|sc|walrus}
.RS
This command is mainly used on the startup script for the specific
component, since it checks that the environment is properly setup for the
component (mainly permission on directory needs to be right for the
eucalyptus user).
.RE

.BI --cc-port\ <port>
.RS
.RE
.BI --nc-port\ <port>
.RS
.RE
.BI --user\ <euca_user>
.RS
.RE
.BI --dhcpd\ <dhcpd>
.RS
.RE
.BI --dhcp_user\ <user>
.RS
These commands modify eucalyptus.conf so the changes will be reflected at
the restart of the services.
