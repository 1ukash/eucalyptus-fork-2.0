    confirmation dialog for deletion of users
  - User-initiated password recovery mechanism
  - Fixed a couple of bugs: ' ' in username, spurious double additions
- Revamped logging throughout, with five levels a la log4j
- Cloud Controller:
  - User, Cluster, and System keys are now stored in PKCS#12 keystores and have moved to var/lib/eucalyptus/keys
  - Configuration is handled entirely through the web interface
    - Clusters dynamically added/started/stopped
    - Webservices operations complete up to EC2 2008-05-05 (w/o EBS):

     network parameters (instead of hardcoded 10. network)

   - Pure in-memory database
   - Image registration over WS interface
   - Improved build procedure
- Web interface improvements:
    - For all users (query interface credentials, listing of
      available images)
    - For the administrator (addition, approval, disabling,
      and deletion of users; disabling of images)
- Numerous bug fixes, improving stability and performance.
   In particular, but not limited to:
   - Recovering Cloud Controller system state
